#Why?
x = "10"      # x is a string with value "10"
y = 2         # y is an integer with value 2

print(x * y)  # String * integer → repeats the string "10" two times → "1010"
print(y * x)  # Same as above, multiplication is commutative in this case → "1010"
                # string multiplication of string define special behavior where string will repeat itself
                # python multiplication of string is commutative
