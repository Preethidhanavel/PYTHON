#What will be the output and types in this code?
a = "5"       # a is a string containing "5"
b = 5         # b is an integer

c = a * b     # String * int â†’ repeats the string "5" five times 
d = b * a     # Same as above (order does not matter for string * int)

print(c, d)   # Output: 55555 55555
