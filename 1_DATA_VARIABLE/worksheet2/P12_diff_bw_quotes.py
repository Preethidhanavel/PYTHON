#12.What is the difference between single quotes ('), double quotes ("), 
#and triple quotes (''' or """) for strings? Are they the same data type?
x = 'hello'          # Single quotes string
y = "world"          # Double quotes string
z = '''hello
python
program'''           # Triple single quotes → multi-line string
a = """hi
hello
good 
morning"""           # Triple double quotes → multi-line string

print(x, y, z, a)    # Prints all strings (x, y, z, a)
