#How does Pythonâ€™s dynamic typing affect performance and debugging in large applications?

Python's dynamic typing makes coding fast and flexible because there is no need to declare variable types.
Performance impact: It is slower than languages with static typing, because Python checks types at runtime.
Debugging impact: In large applications, type errors may only show up when the program runs, 
making bugs harder to find and requiring more testing.
